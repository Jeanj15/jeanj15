## Overview

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! This repository serves as an overview of my skills, experience, and hands-on projects in cybersecurity. With a background in both IT and cybersecurity, I have worked across various domains, including malware analysis, security information and event management (SIEM), and vulnerability assessment. Here, I share my knowledge and practical experience, aiming to contribute to the field and collaborate with other security enthusiasts.

## Skills

### Certifications
- **CompTIA Security+**
- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**

### Technical Skills

#### Security Operations
- **SIEM Development**: Proficient in creating SIEM systems using the ELK Stack. I have configured role-based access control (RBAC) and implemented secure communication through SSL/TLS and authentication mechanisms.
- **Data Visualization and Dashboards**: Customized dashboards in Kibana for real-time monitoring and analysis. Developed alerting mechanisms to identify suspicious activities and potential security incidents.

#### Malware Analysis
- **Tools**: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, Wireshark, Process Monitor
- **Experience**: Conducted malware analysis to study threat behaviors, gather Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and understand attack vectors. Familiar with setting up isolated environments for safe malware investigation.

#### Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing
- **Tools**: Nessus, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite
- **CTF (Capture The Flag) Experience**: Developed proficiency in CTF challenges using Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark, and Ghidra for practical threat analysis and response.

#### Network Security
- **Network Protocol Analysis**: Skilled in analyzing network traffic to detect anomalies and potential threats using tools like Wireshark.
- **Security Monitoring**: Experienced in monitoring and defending both Windows and Linux environments against unauthorized access, using SIEM systems and automated alerts.

#### Programming & Scripting
- **Languages**: Python, C/C++, SQL
- **Scripting for Automation**: Developed scripts for data processing, alerting, and automated incident response in security environments.

### Key Projects

1. **SIEM Development with ELK Stack**
   - Developed a full-scale SIEM using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana to manage and analyze security events.
   - Configured RBAC for secure access control and implemented SSL/TLS for secure data transport.
   - Set up custom alerts for various security incidents, enhancing the visibility of network activities and reducing response time.

2. **Cybersecurity Research Analyst (University of Central Florida)**
   - Conducted malware research and network security assessments.
   - Used VMware and Wireshark to analyze and mitigate threats.
   - Assisted in securing campus networks through policy development and vulnerability assessment.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment Lab**
   - Created a vulnerability assessment lab using Nessus, Nmap, and Metasploit to simulate and understand various attack scenarios.
   - Documented findings and provided remediation recommendations, honing my skills in vulnerability management and reporting.
